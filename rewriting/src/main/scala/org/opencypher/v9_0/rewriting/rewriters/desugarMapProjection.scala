/*
Handles rewriting map projection elements to literal entries when possible. If the user
has used an all properties selector ( n{ .* } ), we need to do the work in runtime.
In these situations, the rewriter turns as much as possible into literal entries,
so the runtime only has two cases to handle - literal entries and the special all-props selector.

We can't rewrite all the way to literal maps, since map projections yield a null map when the map_variable is null,
and the same behaviour can't be mimicked with literal maps.
