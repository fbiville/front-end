/**
  * Scopes in Cypher are a little different from scopes in a language such as Java or Scala.
  *
  * In Java, you have scopes that can contain other scopes inside of them. These scopes exist in Cypher
  * as well, but then you also have weird behaviours around WITH. These are modeled by WITH reading from one scope
  * and writing to another.
  *
  * Clauses can read from one and write to another scope, but expressions only read from scopes
  *
  * Objects of this class should not be re-used.
